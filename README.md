# Graphics course
Code clarity is focused on more than code quality for learning benefits.

## Course Focus
* Mathematics and Algorithms use to create and manipulate images
* Synthetic images of three-dimensional objects and scenes
* Lighting and shading
* Ray tracing
* Graphics pipelines
* All software rendering

## Tools
* OpenGL
* GLM
* GLUT
* CMake


## Labs

* Lab 1
  * Setting up environment and setting pixels to draw simple shapes
* Lab 2
    * 3D Vector mathematics, transformations, trigonometric functions
    * Miscellaneous mathematics required for graphics
* Lab 3
    * More miscellaneous mathematics
    * 2D/3D objects + vectors
* Lab 4 & 5
    * 3d objects in scene + planes
    * shading models on top of objects (directional, positional ,spotlight)
* Project 1
    * Built from lab4 so it resides in the lab4 folder.
    * Reflections, shadows, ellipsoids and polygons.
    * Includes night/day mode. (m,n keys)
    
    
    ### Project 1 Images

## How to run projects

Run the following commands in order.

`cd <lab name>/build`

`cmake ..`

`make all && ./output`
